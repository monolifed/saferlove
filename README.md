# saferlove
Uses encryption to make your source files harder to read

# How it works
1) run `make safer.so` to create the module
2) run `make encryptfiles` to encrypt files listed in `filelist.lua`
3) for release you need conf.lua, *.lus files and safer.so

# Warning
This doesn't provide any security.
It just makes seeing the code a little harder.
